BAPA Z3 integration
===================

A plugin for the [Z3 SMT solver](http://z3.codeplex.com). The plugin is written
in Scala, and relies on [ScalaZ3](https://github.com/psuter/ScalaZ3) to work.
It naturally also relies on Z3. Precompiled versions --for 32bit Linux
systems-- of both are included in this repository. Please note that Z3 comes
with its own license.
